Final Project for CIS-196 Ruby on Rails Web Development @ University of Pennsylvania (Spring 2020)

This is a website that I made for my final project.
It is an online market where users can post listings of the items that they have. Other features include sorting by categories and a 'My Feed' page that displays listings of the categories that a user follows.

To run on localhost:

* bundle install

* rails db:migrate

* rake db:seed

* rails s -b 0.0.0.0
